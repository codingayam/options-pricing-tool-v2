## Executive Summary
Develop an MVP options pricing comparison tool that enables users to compare market prices against Black-Scholes and Power Law pricing models for any ticker across multiple strike prices and expiry dates through an intuitive visualization interface.

## Core User Need
**As a trader/analyst**, I need to quickly compare how different pricing models value options so I can identify potential mispricings and make informed trading decisions.

## MVP Scope Definition

### In Scope (MVP)
- Single ticker analysis with multiple expiry dates
- Market price vs Black-Scholes vs Power Law comparison
- Interactive line chart visualization
- Basic input validation and error handling
- Call and Put option support

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Multi-ticker comparison
- Historical analysis/backtesting
- Advanced Greeks calculations beyond BS requirements
- Portfolio-level analysis
- Real-time data streaming
- Advanced filtering/sorting capabilities

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Data Input & Validation
**User Story**: As a user, I need to specify analysis parameters so the system can fetch and analyze the appropriate options data.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- User must provide ticker symbol (required, validated against yfinance availability)
- User must select option type: Call or Put (required, radio button selection)
- User can optionally specify date range for expiry analysis (defaults to next 6 months if not provided)
- System validates ticker exists and has options data before proceeding
- Clear error messages for invalid inputs

**Technical Specifications**:
- Input validation using yfinance ticker validation
- Date range picker with reasonable defaults (30 days to 180 days from current date)
- Form validation prevents submission with missing required fields

### FR2: Data Acquisition
**User Story**: As a user, I need the system to automatically fetch all necessary market data so I can focus on analysis rather than data collection.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System fetches current market prices for all available options within date range
- System retrieves underlying stock price (S0), volatility, risk-free rate, and dividends for Black-Scholes
- System calculates 95th percentile returns for Power Law model
- System handles API failures gracefully with retry logic

**Technical Specifications**:
- Use yfinance library for all data retrieval
- Fetch options chain data for specified expiry dates
- Calculate implied volatility from market prices if not directly available
- Use Treasury bill rates for risk-free rate (fallback to 2% if unavailable)
- Store 95th percentile return calculation for each expiry duration

### FR3: Black-Scholes Pricing Engine
**User Story**: As a user, I need accurate Black-Scholes valuations so I can compare theoretical fair value against market prices.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System calculates Black-Scholes prices for all strike prices and expiry dates
- Separate formulas implemented for calls and puts
- Results match standard financial calculator outputs within 0.01 precision
- Handles edge cases (very high/low strikes, near-expiry options)

**Technical Specifications**:

**Black-Scholes Call Option Formula**:
```
C = S0 * N(d1) - K * e^(-r*t) * N(d2)

Where:
d1 = (ln(S0/K) + (r + σ²/2)*t) / (σ*√t)
d2 = d1 - σ*√t

Variables:
- C = Call option price
- S0 = Current stock price
- K = Strike price
- r = Risk-free rate
- t = Time to expiry (in years)
- σ = Volatility
- N(x) = Cumulative standard normal distribution
```

**Black-Scholes Put Option Formula**:
```
P = K * e^(-r*t) * N(-d2) - S0 * N(-d1)

Where d1 and d2 are calculated as above
- P = Put option price
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Use scipy.stats.norm.cdf for normal distribution calculations
- Handle numerical precision issues for extreme parameter values
- Validate that all input parameters are positive and reasonable

### FR4: Power Law Pricing Engine
**User Story**: As a user, I need Power Law pricing calculations so I can see alternative valuation methods based on tail risk assumptions.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- System calculates Power Law prices for alpha values from 2.0 to 4.0 in 0.5 increments
- Separate calculations for calls and puts using specified formulas
- Results are mathematically consistent and handle boundary conditions
- Multiple alpha values displayed for comparison

**Technical Specifications**:

**Power Law Call Option Formula**:
```
C(K2) = (((K2-S0)/(K1-S0))^(1-alpha)) * C(K1)

Variables:
- C(K2) = Price of call option at target strike K2 under power law
- C(K1) = Price of call option at reference strike K1 (closest to 95th percentile return)
- K1 = Strike price closest to 95th percentile return for price increase
- K2 = Target strike price for calculation
- S0 = Current underlying price
- alpha = Power law exponent (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0)
```

**Power Law Put Option Formula**:
```
P(K2) = P(K1) * ( (K2-S0)^(1-alpha) - ( S0^(1-alpha) * ((alpha-1)*K2 + S0)) / ( (K1-S0)^(1-alpha) - (S0^(1-alpha))*((alpha-1)*K1 + S0)))

Variables:
- P(K2) = Price of put option at target strike K2 under power law
- P(K1) = Price of put option at reference strike K1 (closest to 95th percentile downward return)
- K1 = Strike price closest to 95th percentile downward return
- K2 = Target strike price for calculation
- S0 = Current underlying price
- alpha = Power law exponent (2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0)
```

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Calculate 95th percentile returns using historical data over expiry duration
- Handle mathematical edge cases where denominators approach zero
- Validate that power law calculations produce reasonable results
- Default alpha display to 3.0 with option to show other values

### FR5: Interactive Visualization
