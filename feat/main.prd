Main features
1. User can compare options for a particular ticker across different expiry dates and different strike prices, especially their prices against what is derived from black scholes, and what is derived from a power law. 
- User can specify ticker (required), date range (optional), type of option - whether call or put (required). 
- this will call yfinance and fetch any information available, ideally all the greeks and most definitely the parameters required to compute black scholes.
- Black scholes should be calculated based on formula. Differnet formulas for call and put options.
- for power law pricing, this will depend on a few parameters: (a) duration of options looking at in terms of time to expiry, let's call this t, (b) find the 95% percentile return of the ticker for duration t, (c) alpha - range of values from 2-4 in increments of 0.5). The call option formula is C(K2) = (((K2-S0)/(K1-S0))^(1-alpha)) * C(K1), where C(K2) is the price of the call option we want to determine under power law, C(K1) is the price of the call option whose strike price is closest to the 95th percentile return (for increase in price), K1 is the strike price which is closest to the 95th percentile return (for price increase), K2 is each strike price) and S0 is the underlying price of the ticker at latest market price. So the idea is calculate power law price for each option at different strike prices for the different expiry durations.
- Similarly, to calculate power law pricing for put options, the formula is P(K2) = P(K1) * ( (K2-S0)^(1-alpha) -( S0^(1-alpha) * ((alpha-1)*K2 + S0)) / ( (K1-S0)^(1-alpha) - (S0 ^ (1-alpha))*((alpha-1)*K1 + S0))), where P(K2) is the power law price of the put option of the target strike price at each strike price, P(K1) is the price of the put option of the strike price closest to 95th percentile return (downward return), K1 is the strike price of the put option closest to the 95th percentile return (downward return), K2 is the strike price available, and S0 is the underlying stock or ticker latest market price or closing price, alpha is a range of values from 2 to 4, in increments of 0.5. 
- So there should be a clear and intuitive UI to present the difference in currentmarket price of each option at different strike prices at different expiry dates all with their black scholes pricing and the power law pricing, all at the same time in a single view, probablyt throguh line charts where each unit is an option at a particular expiry date but with different strike prices, and we have 3 lines representing each form of pricing, each line is differnt color and contrasts well so user can see easily. and there will be however many units based on how many different expiry dates there are.
